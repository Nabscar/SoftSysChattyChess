# Chatty Chess
### Nabih Estefan & Oscar De La Garza


#### Goals
For our Project we wish to make chess rooms for people to log on and play. However with the twist that people would be able to join over the Olin network in their linux terminal and choose a room that they can then play either another person or a computer. For a lower bound we’d hope to at least have the rooms setup for anyone to join into and play against someone in a chess game. For stretch we would enjoy being able to implement these functions as well as add the possibility of implementing an AI, which would be the only major part we don’t write directly, but do write the implementation to get the moves and represent them against the opponent. As well as allow for spectating and chat functions for all attending parties.

#### Learning Goals
We wish to learn about network programming and how client/server side access is achieved and set up to bring users an interface that they can then use. We also wish to learn how programming a game works in c and how we can then attach that to our client chat rooms that we will be making in tandem. All in all, it sounds like a big task but we are excited and ready.

#### Resources
A basic understanding of how server/client chat rooms work in linux and how we can set those up. As well as a grasp on how to program a complex game like chess and then implement it into the chatrooms we wish to make. We know a previous group has done something similar, and for starting resources may reference some of theirs but we wish to ultimately avoid doing so as to not copy their project. We are much more focused on the chess aspect of this project and plan to look for basic game development in c resources as well as how to do so in terminal output.

#### First Steps

- Detail and layout timelines and deadlines for the project and begin task distribution. Scheduling is important, especially for what could be a tougher project like this. - This can be done by both of us deciding on and creating a google or outlook calendar with dates and divvying up tasks to reach those deadlines through trello. Oscar & Nabih
- Do tasks such as research chat rooms and how they can be made and set up in linux and begin implementation - at minimum having the code begun or even a blank room set up that we can join and test is a good start - Nabih / Oscar
- Research video game development and how that can be implemented into terminal space for a user. - having a basic board and pieces drawn into terminal( not necessarily into the chat rooms yet) without needing all the rules and restrictions on moves yet - Oscar / Nabih
